This project is a simple artistic website that was also originally interlaced with a chatbot designed to 
talk about gluten-free recipes and assist with meal prepping. For now the, the project has been migrated to
OpenAI's chat GPT 3.5 turbo API. While originally specialized, and quite simple on a vertex ai assitant,
it now stands on its own as a functional gpt for personal use offsite. I the future I will learning about
OpenAI's assistant API and whether or not it is beneficial. A user database will be implemented with SQL
in the next phase to allow for login and storing of chats.
