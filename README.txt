This project is a simple artistic website that was also interlaced with a chatbot designed to 
talk about gluten-free recipes and assist with meal prepping. It is currently depreceated and now 
will only lay out a basic website. In the future this wil be implemented with chatgpt and launched
as an accessible site. As of now it stands as an example of implementing html,css, javascript, and
python all together to simulate the feel of a modern website.
