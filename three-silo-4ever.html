        <h1>Who am I</h1>
    </header>
   <header> I am an experienced scientific technician scripting my way into the tech industry. Choosing to study Biology in my undergraduate career,
     I traveled the country assisting in many Avian Field projects. It was in this field that I witnessed the research process first hand. 
     By the time Graduation rolled around I was seasoned, having worked on numerous experiments in the field and in the lab. 
     Specifically, one of these experiences involved me working directly with the computer science department. 
     While pilot testing new data loggers to track bird movement, my coworker in the computer science department began to teach me some of practices in computer science as
     I demonstrated the protocols for handling wild birds.<br>
    <br>
    Throughout my time working in the field, this project stuck with me. I had traveled most of the United States
    and found that I desired a home. The endless potential that I saw in Seattle allured me after I happened to visit.
    I saw new technology everywhere, a beautiful landscape, and people genuinely working hard to intertwine the two. 
    When I landed here I was astounded by the amount of laboratory science available
    and eventually found myself working in a histology lab. I had been promoted to a technical
    position within the company because of my close attention to detail and adaptability.
    However, the seeds of unfulfillment began to grow in me. Knowing internally that I wanted more,
    more knowledge and the ability to apply it directly in my life, I sought out Graduate School.<br>
    <br>
    I delved into courses from freecodecamp and codecademy, and the excitement I felt was undeniable.
    Artificial Intelligence was exploding across the news and after trying chat GPT for the first time, I was hooked.
    With this tool, I was empowered to script programs with speed and efficieny that were unthinkable before.
    I wanted to study this and I was going to focus in AI.<br>
    <br>
    After my first year of graduate school, I feel inspired and commited to this path I have taken. 
    I have performed well in school, currently holding a 3.7 gpa without having any previous experience
    in this field. As well as this simple site, I have also created a terminal based program that displays
    an approximation of the Earth's position in its orbit as well as fun facts sourced from NASA.
